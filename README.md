### Regression ：Boston_Linear_SGDR_Ridge_Lasso.ipynb

Requirement ：

Use the Machine Learning Lib Sklearn to predict the Boston housing prices.

(1)Handwriting a Single Regression model with Least squares method to predict the prices, and evaluate the R2, MSE, MAE.

(2)Use the LinearRegression and SGDRegressor of Sklearn Lib to Regression which multi-variable, visualize the results and compare the R2, MSE, MAE.

(3)Use the Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression of the regularization method to Regression which multi-variable, visualize the results and compare the R2, MSE, MAE.

(4)Please separate training and test sets by yourself.



## Classification ：hand_recog.ipynb

Requirement ：

Use the Machine Learning Lib Sklearn to recognize the hand-written digits from 0-9.

(1)Perform corresponding statistical analysis and visualization of the data set.

(2)Handwriting a perceptron to classify any two classes of handwritten numbers, and evaluate the performance.

(3)Use the KNN and SVM classification model of Sklearn Lib to classify the digits from 0-9, compared the performance of the model and analyze the results.

(4)Use the SVM of Sklearn Lib to classify any two classes of handwritten numbers, and evaluate the performance.
